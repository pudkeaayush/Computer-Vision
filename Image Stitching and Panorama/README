The goal here is to create two panoramas :
1. Using homographies and perspective warping on a common plane
2. Using cylindrical warping
The input used in both cases are : input1.png , input2.png and input3.png.
The output image in both the panoramas are produced by transforming the input2 and input3 to the plane of input1.

To run the code simply use the below command:
python main.py 1 input1.png input2.png input3.png ./Results/

After running the code, both the images would be saved in the Results folder created in the current directory.
